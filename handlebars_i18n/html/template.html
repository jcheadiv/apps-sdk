<h4><span>Don the Beachcomber Mai Tai</span></h4> 
<p>This version is much closer to what {{name}} served in his restaurants. It can be garnished with various fruits, as in the above recipe. Falernum, which is now difficult to obtain in the United States except from a single supplier in Seattle, is a flavored Caribbean syrup with a very different taste from the Orgeat syrup used in the Maitai #1.</p> 
<p>Ingredients</p> 
<ul> 
<li>2 oz (or 1/4 cup) water</li> 
<li>3/4 oz or 1-1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
